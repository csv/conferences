With the rise of big data, conventional data presentation approaches have
become limiting. In order to make sense of complex realtime data, we need
new data exploration approaches.

Conventional data exploration relies heavily on static data visualization.
Visualization is quite powerful, but it requires attention, and it can only
go so far.

We propose data gastronomification as an approach for ubiquitous, passive
consumption of high-dimensional realtime data. Data gastronomification allows
us to use all five senses dynamically, thus allowing for the expression of
many variables in one gastronomification.

In this talk, we talk about ways that we and others have used data
gastronomification and provide practical suggestions as to how you can apply
data gastronomification in your business.
